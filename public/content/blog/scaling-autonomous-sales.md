## The Bottleneck is Biological

In traditional sales organizations, the primary constraint on growth is human capacity. An SDR can realistically make 50-80 dials a day. They get tired. They have bad days. They require management, motivation, and caffeine.

**Autonomous Sales Representatives (ASRs) change the fundamental physics of the sales funnel.**

When you decouple lead generation from biological limits, you don't just get "cheaper" leads. You get:
1.  **Infinite Elasticity:** Scale from 100 to 10,000 calls per day instantly.
2.  **Perfect Adherence:** The script is followed 100% of the time.
3.  **Data Purity:** Every objection is logged, categorized, and analyzed without bias.

### The New Unit Economics

If your CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) relies on human SDRs, you are renting your growth. If you build an ASR infrastructure, you are owning your growth engine.

### Implementation Strategy

Don't fire your sales team. Elevate them. Move your humans to the bottom of the funnel (Closing) and let the AI handle the top (Opening). The specialized human touch becomes more valuable when it is focused solely on qualified intent.
