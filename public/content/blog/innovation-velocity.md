## Speed is the Only Moat

In the current AI landscape, technology is commoditized quickly. The only sustainable advantage is **implementation velocity**.

Teams often get stuck in "Model Paralysis"—waiting for GPT-5, or endlessly tweaking prompts before a single user sees the product. This is a strategic error.

### The 80/20 Rule of AI Deployment

1.  **Ship the 'Good Enough' Model:** A 90% accurate model today is infinitely more valuable than a 99% accurate model next month.
2.  **Build Feedback Loops:** The product isn't the model; the product is the system that improves the model based on user data.
3.  **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):** Use humans to handle the edge cases while the AI handles the bulk. This ensures quality while training the next version of your system.

### Case Study: ASR

When building the Autonomous Sales Rep, we didn't wait for the voice latency to be zero. We built masking audio ("One second, let me check that...") to handle the latency. We shipped. We got data. We improved.
